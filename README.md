  ## Project Objective
  In this assignment, we will create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. We will follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query  and route data in our app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
  
  ## User Story
  As a user I want to be able to track burgers that I want to eat and burgers I have eaten in an easy to use web application.
  ## Technologies 
  ```
  - node.js
  - mysql
  - express

  ```
  
  ## Installation
